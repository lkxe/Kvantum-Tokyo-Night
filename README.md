# A kvantum theme for Tokyo Night color palette
This theme is a modified version of [0xsch1zo's](https://github.com/0xsch1zo) [Kvantum-Tokyo-Night-Theme](https://github.com/colin-heffernan/Kvantum-Tokyo-Night-Theme) which is a modified version of [colin-heffernan's](https://github.com/colin-heffernan) [Kvantum-Tokyo-Night-Theme](https://github.com/colin-heffernan/Kvantum-Tokyo-Night-Theme). I pretty much only changed the accent color to blue and removed the border around the folder view.
